# Report format and LLM handoff

This document describes the exported zip a recorded session produces. It also shows how to hand `report.md` to an LLM coding agent so the agent can diagnose what you did and what went wrong.

We assemble the zip in [`lib/export/bundle.ts`](../lib/export/bundle.ts) and [`lib/export/zip.ts`](../lib/export/zip.ts). We render the human-readable report in [`lib/export/markdown.ts`](../lib/export/markdown.ts). The trimming that decides what each verbosity level contains lives in [`lib/export/trimmer.ts`](../lib/export/trimmer.ts).

## Zip layout

We prefix every path with a single root directory named after the session, so the archive unpacks into one folder:

```
<session-name>/
  report.md            # the LLM entry point — self-sufficient at L2/L3
  session.json         # trimmed event stream + session meta, asset refs → zip paths
  MANIFEST.md          # index of every included asset (path, kind, size)
  transcript.json      # voice segments (timestamps + transcript), when audio was recorded
  screenshots/
    001-0004.jpg       # {seq}-{mmss}.jpg — seq order, timestamp in the name
    002-0011.jpg
    …
  network/
    001-api.example.com-todos.json   # {seq}-{host}-{path-slug}.json — full request/response
    …
  files/
    import.csv         # {original-name} — files the user uploaded/attached
    …
  audio/
    001.webm           # {seq}.webm — recorded voice segments
    …
```

Note the following:

- `report.md` is the primary artifact. It is a single chronological narrative with `[mm:ss]` timestamps, section breaks at navigations and tab switches, fenced network bodies and console or error output, screenshot references, and blockquotes for your markers and notes. At L2 and L3 it is self-sufficient: an agent can answer "what happened and what went wrong?" without opening any asset.
- `session.json` is the machine-readable mirror. It holds the trimmed event stream (the same events, in the same order as the report) plus session metadata, with all asset references rewritten to their zip-relative paths. Use it when you want to program against the events rather than read prose.
- `MANIFEST.md` lists every asset actually included in the zip. Some assets are dropped at higher verbosity levels (see below), so the report never points at a file that is not there.
- Asset naming embeds the sequence and timestamp (`{seq}-{mmss}`) so files sort in capture order and cross-reference the `[mm:ss]` marks in `report.md`.
- We include only assets still referenced by a surviving event. The exceptions are annotation screenshots, audio, and file assets, which we always include regardless of level because they are protected signal.

## Verbosity levels

Levels are cumulative transform pipelines, not budget solvers. Each higher level runs the previous level's transforms plus a few more, so the output is deterministic and explainable. The token figures below are calibration targets (a chars/4 estimate), not hard runtime limits.

| Level | Target | What it contains |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
| L0 — full | everything | No trimming. Full request and response bodies up to the capture cap, every screenshot, every event. The complete fidelity that lives in IndexedDB. |
| L1 — standard | about 150k tokens | Static-asset requests (images, fonts, css, and analytics hosts) collapsed to one summary line; response bodies truncated to the first 4 KB (original size noted); consecutive scrolls coalesced; consecutive duplicate console lines deduped with counts; screenshots thinned to key moments; near-duplicate screenshots already folded. |
| L2 — compact | about 50k tokens | Everything in L1, plus JSON bodies reduced to a shape summary (keys, types, and array lengths, for example `{ users: Array(50) of { id, name, email } }`); repeated calls to the same endpoint collapsed to the first occurrence plus a `×N similar` marker (requests with a differing status stay full, because anomalies are signal); screenshots kept only for annotations and errors. |
| L3 — minimal | about 15k tokens | Everything in L2, plus network bodies dropped except those linked to an error or `status >= 400`; interactions stripped to element text and selector only; screenshots reduced to a filename manifest. The result is a narrative skeleton: navigations, clicks, transcript, markers and notes, annotations, and errors with request and response one-liners. |

Pick the lowest level that fits the target model's context window while still containing the bodies and screenshots the question needs. For most debugging, L2 works best: it stays readable and self-sufficient while fitting comfortably in a large context. Drop to L3 only when the session is very long or the model's window is tight. Go to L1 or L0 when you specifically need full response bodies.

### What we never trim at any level

The trimmer skips any event where `isProtected(e)` is true. That covers the following, at every level including L3:

- markers and notes, your explicit signals
- errors (`error` events) and the network requests they link to through `linkedRequestId`, whose bodies stay full
- annotations and their screenshots
- voice segments and transcript
- file captures and attachments (metadata always; we always include the file asset in the zip)
- session notes (rehydrate, detach, info, and warning)

We likewise preserve any event explicitly flagged `protected: true`. So no matter how aggressively you trim for token budget, your intent and every error survive.

## Handing `report.md` to an LLM coding agent

Follow these steps in order:

1. Unzip the archive. Everything the agent needs to read is `report.md`.
2. Paste `report.md` into the agent. If the agent can browse files, attach the whole unzipped folder instead, so it can also open the referenced screenshots and `network/*.json` bodies.
3. If the report is long, export at L2 first. Re-export at a lower or higher level only if the agent asks for more or less detail. Re-export is free and lossless from source, because we retain full fidelity in IndexedDB.

### Suggested prompt

> You are a debugging assistant. Below is `report.md` — a chronological recording
> of a user session in a web app, captured by a browser extension. Timestamps are
> `[mm:ss]` from the start of the session and are the join key across events,
> screenshots, and the voice transcript. Section headings (`##`) mark navigations
> and tab switches. Network requests show method, URL, status, and (depending on
> verbosity) bodies or a JSON shape summary; a `×N similar` marker means repeated
> identical calls were collapsed. Errors are prefixed with `⚠`. The user's own
> markers and notes appear as blockquotes and are the most important signal.
>
> Please:
> 1. Summarize what the user was trying to do, step by step.
> 2. Identify what went wrong — the first error and its likely root cause, citing
>    the `[mm:ss]` timestamps and the specific requests/console lines involved.
> 3. Suggest the concrete code change or investigation that would fix it.
>
> If a detail you need was trimmed (for example a full response body), say which
> `[mm:ss]` event you'd want re-exported at a higher verbosity level.
>
> ```
> <paste report.md here>
> ```

### Tips

- cite timestamps. Asking the agent to reference `[mm:ss]` keeps its answer verifiable against the report and the screenshots.
- trust the blockquotes. Markers and notes are you narrating your own intent. We never trim them, and they are the best anchor for what you expected.
- follow `linkedRequestId`. Errors point at the network request that caused them. At every level we preserve that request's body, so the agent can inspect the exact failing payload.
- escalate verbosity surgically. If the agent needs one full body, re-export at L1 or L0 rather than dumping the whole session at full fidelity.
