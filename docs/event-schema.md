# Event schema (frozen contract)

This document freezes the schema for the recorder's event stream. It is the
authoritative reference for the renderer (`lib/export/markdown`) and the trimmer
(`lib/export/trimmer`). Both read events by `type` and rely on the payload fields
described here being present and shaped as stated.

The runtime source of truth is [`lib/session/types.ts`](../lib/session/types.ts).
Later phases may add new `EventType`s by extending `EventType` and
`EventPayloadMap`, but they must never change the shape of an existing payload. To
change a field's meaning, add a new field instead.

## Envelope

Every event is a `BaseEvent<T>`, a discriminated union member keyed on `type`:

| Field        | Type                        | Meaning |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `id`         | `string`                    | Unique event id (`newId`). |
| `sessionId`  | `string`                    | Owning session id. |
| `t`          | `number`                    | Milliseconds from session start, not epoch. This is the join key across events, screenshots, and the voice transcript. The renderer prints it as `[mm:ss]`. |
| `tabId`      | `number` (optional)         | Source tab, when the event belongs to a specific tab. |
| `type`       | `EventType`                 | Discriminant that selects the payload shape. |
| `importance` | `number`                    | Static importance score, assigned once at capture by `scoreEvent` (see [`lib/session/events.ts`](../lib/session/events.ts)). A higher score survives trimming longer. |
| `protected`  | `boolean` (optional)        | When `true`, the trimmer never drops or compacts this event. The `PROTECTED_TYPES` set also implies protection even when this flag is unset, so the trimmer must consult `isProtected(e)`, not just this flag. |
| `payload`    | `EventPayloadMap[type]`     | Per-type body, documented below. |

A `RawEvent` is what a capture source emits before the background funnel stamps
`id`, `sessionId`, `t`, and `importance`. It carries only `type`, optional `tabId`,
optional `at` (an explicit ms-epoch timestamp; the funnel defaults to now), and
`payload`.

### Shared value objects

- `Rect` is `{ x, y, w, h }` (numbers)
- `Point` is `{ x, y }` (numbers)
- `ElementDescriptor` is a best-effort description of a DOM element, built in a
  content script: `tag` (required), optional `id`, `role`, `ariaLabel`, `name`,
  `text` (visible text, capped at about 80 characters), `selector` (best-effort CSS
  selector: id, then `[data-testid]`, then a short ancestor path), and `rect`
- `NetHeader` is `{ name, value }` (both strings)
- `NetBody` is described under [net-request](#net-request)

### Protected types

`isProtected(e)` returns `true` for any event with `protected: true`, and for all
of these types whatever the flag says:
`marker`, `note`, `annotation`, `voice-segment`, `error`, `file-captured`,
`file-attached`, `session-note`. These are the user's explicit signals plus
errors, the reason the recording exists, so the trimmer must preserve them at
every verbosity level.

## Interaction events

### `click`
`ClickPayload` records a pointer click on an element.

| Field        | Type                 | Meaning |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------- |
| `descriptor` | `ElementDescriptor`  | The clicked element. |
| `modifiers`  | `string[]`           | Held modifier keys, for example `['ctrl','shift']`. Empty array when none. |
| `button`     | `number` (optional)  | Mouse button (0 = primary), when not the default. |

### `input`
`InputPayload` records a committed value change on a form field.

| Field       | Type                | Meaning |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| `descriptor`| `ElementDescriptor` | The field. |

| `redacted`  | `boolean`           | True for sensitive fields, such as passwords or tokens, per `isSensitiveInput`. When true, `value` holds the marker, never the real input. |
| `inputType` | `string` (optional) | The `<input type=…>`, for example `password` or `email`. |

### `scroll`
`ScrollPayload` records a scroll gesture. It has the lowest importance, and the
trimmer coalesces runs of consecutive scrolls on the same tab.

| Field      | Type                | Meaning |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------- |
| `from`     | `Point`             | Scroll offset before the gesture. |
| `to`       | `Point`             | Scroll offset after. |
| `container`| `string` (optional) | Selector of the scroll container, or `'window'`. |

### `key`
`KeyPayload` records a notable key press, such as Enter, Escape, Tab, or a
shortcut chord.

| Field       | Type                          | Meaning |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `key`       | `string`                      | Normalized key, for example `'Enter'`, `'Escape'`, or `'Ctrl+K'`. |
| `modifiers` | `string[]`                    | Held modifiers. |
| `descriptor`| `ElementDescriptor` (optional)| The focused element, when known. |

## Deep-capture events

### `net-request`
`NetRequestPayload` records one network request and response, assembled from CDP
`Network.*` events. When redaction is enabled, it applies to headers, URL, and

| `bodyShape`      | `{ request?: string; response?: string }` (optional) | The trimmer sets this when it reduces a body to a JSON shape summary. |

`NetBody` is `{ present, mime?, text?, truncated?, originalSize?, assetId?, base64? }`:
- `present` is whether a body exists. It is false when the CDP body was evicted.
- `mime` is the body MIME type
- `text` is the body text, possibly truncated or redacted
- `truncated` is true when `text` was cut to the inline cap
- `originalSize` is the original size in bytes, before truncation

- `base64` is true when `text` is base64 (a binary body)

`WsFrame` is `{ dir: 'sent' | 'recv'; opcode: number; ts: number; text?: string; truncated?: boolean }`. `ts` is milliseconds from session start.

### `console`
`ConsolePayload` records a `console.*` call or a non-error `Log.entryAdded`.

### `annotation`
`AnnotationPayload` records a set of shapes drawn over a screenshot. It is
protected. The renderer describes each shape and its target element in text, so
the report reads without opening the image.

`AnnotationShape` is `{ tool, color, strokeWidth, points?, rect?, from?, to?, text?, targetDescriptor? }`:
- `tool` is one of `pen \| arrow \| rect \| ellipse \| text \| highlighter \| redact`
- `color` and `strokeWidth` set the stroke styling
- `points` is the path for `pen` and `highlighter`
- `rect` is the bounds for `rect`, `ellipse`, and `redact`
- `from` and `to` are the endpoints for `arrow`
